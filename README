1. Cartographer

Cartographer is a set of tools for parsing and compiling Surveyor[1] surveys.

2. Relationship to Surveyor

Surveyor does not provide access to a survey parse tree.  It also does not
expose any public hooks for compiling Surveyor surveys to any form except the
form expected by Surveyor's ActionView partials and compatible views.

Cartographer is a more modular design.  It provides tools to generate an AST
of a survey, perform some basic verifications on it (e.g. checking for
unresolvable or duplicate question references), and a compiler that provides
hooks for various backends.  A backend that prints out the parse tree is
provided as an example.  A backend that generates surveys as a Web page with
Javascript providing dependency evaluation logic is in progress.

Currently, Cartographer is not at feature parity with Surveyor.  Nevertheless,
the present state of Cartographer is still useful for survey tasks where
loading surveys into a Rails application is not necessary and/or
time-consuming.  Tasks that generate products based on survey structure (e.g.
generating or verifying translation files) often fall into this category.

3. Development and usage

You will need a Ruby 1.9 implementation; Cartographer makes heavy use of Ruby
1.9 features, such as BasicObject and fibers.  Cartographer is known to work
on Rubinius 2.0.0.rc1 and Ruby 1.9.3.

The short version:

  $ bundle install
  $ ruby driver.rb [SURVEYOR SURVEY]

By default, driver.rb will use the pretty-printer backend.  Read the backend
and AST to see how to use the tree visitor and what properties you can access
on each node.

You can use the webpage backend by setting the BACKEND environment variable:

  $ BACKEND=Webpage ruby driver.rb [SURVEY]

Keep in mind, however, that the webpage backend is currently very incomplete.

Cartographer does not have an automated test suite, but should.

4. Authorship and license

Cartographer was written by David Yip at NUBIC[2] when he wanted a faster way
to work with Surveyor surveys.

Cartographer is released under the MIT license.  See LICENSE for details.
